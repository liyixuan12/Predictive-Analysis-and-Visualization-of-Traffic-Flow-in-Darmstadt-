### Abstract:
Our work: PAaV - TF Darmstadt, analyzes traffic data for Darmstadt from the world's largest city comparison study UTD19.
Based on sensor-based traffic flow and geospatial data, we present time series prediction methods as well as visualization and analysis of geospatial data to evaluate tools that can help urban planners to solve road capacity planning problems while maintaining cities as livable spaces.
